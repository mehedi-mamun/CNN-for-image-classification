# CNN for Image Classification

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **image classification** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The model is designed to process image datasets and predict their respective categories. It uses fundamental deep learning techniques, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify images into their respective classes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN uses:

- **Conv2D** layers for feature extraction
- **Pooling** layers for dimensionality reduction
- **Dense layers** for classification tasks

The project is implemented using Python and TensorFlow.

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- **TensorFlow** (>= 2.15)
- **Keras** (Included in TensorFlow)
- **NumPy** (>= 1.23.0)
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
```

---

## Installation

To set up this project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for better package management:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

---

## Dataset

This project assumes the availability of an image dataset organized into folders:

```
dataset/
    train/
        class_1/
        class_2/
        ...
    test/
        class_1/
        class_2/
        ...
```

Replace `class_1`, `class_2` with your dataset categories.

You can use any publicly available datasets like:

- CIFAR-10
- MNIST
- ImageNet (small samples)

---

## Usage

To train and test the CNN:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `CNN for Image Classification.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "CNN for Image Classification.ipynb"
   ```

2. Run each cell sequentially.

3. Update paths to your dataset folder if required.

4. Train the model and observe training performance.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:

- **Input Layer**: Images resized to a specific dimension.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction using filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsampling to reduce dimensions.
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts 2D features into a 1D vector.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Dropout**: Reduces overfitting.

---

## Results

### Model Performance:
- **Accuracy**: Achieved X% accuracy on the test set.
- **Loss**: Achieved Y% validation loss.

Example output visualization:

- Training/Validation Accuracy Plot
- Training/Validation Loss Plot
- Sample Predictions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `_ARRAY_API not found`
This error occurs due to incompatibilities between TensorFlow and NumPy versions. Ensure the correct versions are installed:

```bash
pip install "numpy>=1.23,<2.0" "tensorflow>=2.15"
```

Restart your environment/kernel after updating the packages.
